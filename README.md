In addition to my portfolio work, I specialize in MERN Stack web development, proficiently navigating through HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, React, JavaScript, Express.js, and MongoDB. Beyond web development, I am skilled in C and C++, with a keen eye for optimizing code and enhancing performance. As an undergraduate Teaching Assistant in Object-Oriented Programming with C++, I have honed my skills in guiding and mentoring others through complex programming concepts.</p>
